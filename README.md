fries-chrome-app
================

Use fries inside a chrome app.


Ok this really does nothing but wrap a webview in a app window and load the fries example page.

Howto
=====

Check out the repository.
Open chrome settings click on extensions ensure developer mode option is ticked.
Click load unpacked extension browse to the folder its checked out too.
Once loaded it can be launched.

Resizing the webview when the app resizes was a bit of a challenge the result in index.js
is based on suggestions on stackoverflow.
